\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
a abstract base class that is parent to all the different UI elements 

For the UI element the order of update logic and rending matters.

Update Logic\+: We first check if we should execute the funciton for the element with Do\+Element() function which returns a boolean value. Another method for some but not all of the UI Element is to check if the m\+\_\+is\+Selected value is true or false. On the same note the order for checking update logic is from top left to bottom right-- like reading a english book.

Render Logic\+: The order for render logic is to go from bottom to top starting form bottom-\/right to left. This is because of how rendering works where things drawn last is always on top.
