\begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Todo}
\item[\mbox{\hyperlink{todo__todo000012}{Todo}}]make it so that if two or more player are in the same tile then offset the player so that they are visually. One way to do this could be to add a vector of player\+Ptr to tile where if a player get to the tile player will push itself back to this list and will save ther player index to itself. and once a player moves on it will call a function to update itself leaving the tile thus updating other player position in the tile list\end{DoxyRefDesc}
